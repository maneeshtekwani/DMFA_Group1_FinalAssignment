For the final project, Group 1 decided to examine a dataset on oil spill incidents that took place in the state of New York. The dataset provides administrative information about each spill that occurred in their DEC region, with a unique seven-digit spill number. Additionally, the dataset also provides information on the program facility name and location, the categorical entities responsible for the spill, the spill date, location, cause, material, material type, quantity spilled, quantity recovered, units measured, affected waterbody, and the close date of the incident (the date when the cleanup activity is complete and all the paperwork for the incident is processed). The dataset is accessible for download in CSV format through the data.gov link here: https://data.ny.gov/api/views/u44d-k5fk/rows.csv. The size of the dataset is 97 MB and was last updated on 12/10/2023, according to Data.gov. The dataset has 500,000+ transactional records and 20 variables. Each record represents a unique spill incident that occurred in the state of New York.
